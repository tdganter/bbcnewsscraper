Welcome to our news aggregator app made with Python!

To use this app, you must first do the following pip installs:

pip install newsapi-python
pip install requests
pip install bs4

and don't forget to makemigrations and migrate as well!

This news app can search header tags in BBC news currently, so if you have a specific article you are trying to find,
you can search a key word from the article's title. Or if you are simply searching for a topic that is of interest, you
will find articles that have your search word(s) in the title. If you have made an account already, you can see/delete your
search history, and save/delete articles that may be of interest to you. 

The app currently only scrapes from the BBC news website, but we can add more news sources down the line fairly easily.

Happy searching!
